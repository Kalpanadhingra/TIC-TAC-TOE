A Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter library in VS Code! This experience allowed me to explore graphics and create a two-way interaction interface, complete with pop-up messages to alert players when someone wins or when the match ends in a draw. It was a great way to enhance my skills in GUI development and user interaction.

I explore the graphics , how to make a 2-way interaction interface and generate a pop up message when the player wins or match draw.
